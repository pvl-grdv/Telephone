Telephone is a VoIP SIP softphone for Mac. It allows you to make phone
calls over the Internet or your company network. If your phone line
supports SIP protocol, you can use it on your Mac instead of a
physical phone anywhere you have a decent network connection.

## Building

The personal fork currently targets Apple silicon and macOS 15.6 or newer.

Third-party dependencies are pinned and built by the repository bootstrap
script:

- Opus 1.5.2
- LibreSSL 4.3.2
- PJSIP 2.17

Build the dependencies:

    $ ./script/bootstrap_third_party.sh

Build Telephone:

    $ ./script/build.sh Debug

Build and run the local app:

    $ ./script/build_and_run.sh

CI uses ad-hoc signing. For repeated local development, create a stable self-signed
code-signing identity once so macOS Keychain/TCC can recognize subsequent builds:

    $ bash ./script/create_local_signing_identity.sh
    $ export TELEPHONE_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Telephone Local Development"
    $ ./script/build_and_run.sh

This identity is local to your Mac and does not require an Apple Developer
Program membership. If `TELEPHONE_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` is unset, the build
scripts fall back to ad-hoc signing.

The bootstrap script records dependency versions in each installation prefix,
so an existing checkout is rebuilt automatically when a pinned version changes.
Telephone-specific PJSIP patches live in `ThirdParty/PJSIP/patches`.
